# Tackling-counterfeit-products-using-CNN
Counterfeit products are a billion dollar market now.  In this project we are trying to identify the counterfeit products using the image processing techniques. In a joint report published by OECD and EUIPO in 2019, counterfeit products amounted to $509 billion, representing 2.5% of world trade. These products are often threat for the brands and the fund raised from such markets are source for funding in illegal activities. So, identifying and eliminating such products from the market is the need of the hour.
